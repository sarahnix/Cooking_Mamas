# Cooking_Mamas
Cooking Mamas is a project that takes in user inputted ingredients and matches them to recipes with short cooking times

Recipes are taken from https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions (a dataset providing recipes from Food.com)

This dataset was slightly modified for the purposes of Cooking Mamas, temp_recipes4.csv is the final version that was used for this project.

In a video documenting our project, a smaller dataset was used for the purposes of demonstration
